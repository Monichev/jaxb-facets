* JAXB-FACETS *
***************

The JAXB-facets tool provides a small extension to JAXB to support XSD facets in 
Schema files generated by JAXB.

JAXB-facets depends on JAXB RI (http://jaxb.java.net/) and may be used in combination 
with JAX-WS RI (http://jax-ws.java.net/).

JAXB-facets has been tested with versions JAXB 2.2.6 and JAX-WS 2.2.1. It may be 
compatible with other versions, but this may require adjustments to the code.

- INSTALLATION

Make sure that you have the JAXB and JAX-WS implementation JAR files in the Java 
classpath, and make sure that jaxb-facets.jar appears in the classpath *BEFORE* these 
JARs. Note that it is required to add the implementation of JAXB and JAX-WS - the 
APIs alone are generally not sufficient.

The implementation adds 3 new lines of code to the class 
com.sun.xml.bind.v2.schemagen.XmlSchemaGenerator, which is part of JAXB RI. 
These lines are indicated with comment lines starting with "//jaxb-facets". You may 
use the provided version of this class in combination with JAXB 2.2.6 and JAX-WS 2.2.1, 
or you may try to add these changes to other versions (however, this has not been tested).

- USAGE

* Use the provided annotation classes @Facets, @MinOccurs and @MaxOccurs to annotate 
  class attributes. One obvious use case is when you implement a JAX-WS Web service 
  and define the service input as a JAXB class. Upon deployment of the Web service 
  (e.g., using javax.xml.ws.Endpoint.publish(...)), the XML Schema generator (with the
  aid of JAXB-facets) will generate the according XSD including the artifacts for 
  facets, minOccurs and maxOccurs.
